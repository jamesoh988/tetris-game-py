## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- pygame library

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jamesoh988/tetris-game-py.git
cd tetris-game-py
```

2. Create a virtual environment (recommended):
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install pygame:
```bash
pip install pygame
```

## How to Play

### Running the Game

```bash
python main.py
```

### Controls

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| ‚Üê Left Arrow | Move piece left |
| ‚Üí Right Arrow | Move piece right |
| ‚Üì Down Arrow | Soft drop (move piece down faster) |
| ‚Üë Up Arrow | Rotate piece clockwise |
| Space | Hard drop (instantly drop piece to bottom) |
| Esc | Quit game |

### Game Rules

1. **Objective**: Clear horizontal lines by filling them completely with tetromino pieces
2. **Piece Movement**: Tetrominoes fall from the top of the screen
3. **Line Clearing**: When a horizontal line is completely filled, it disappears and you earn points
4. **Game Over**: The game ends when pieces stack up to the top of the playing field
5. **Scoring**: Points are awarded for clearing lines, with bonus points for clearing multiple lines simultaneously

### Tetromino Pieces

- **I-piece** (Cyan): Long straight piece (4 blocks)
- **L-piece** (Orange): L-shaped piece
- **J-piece** (Blue): Reverse L-shaped piece
- **O-piece** (Yellow): Square piece (2x2)
- **T-piece** (Purple): T-shaped piece
- **S-piece** (Green): S-shaped piece
- **Z-piece** (Red): Z-shaped piece

## Game Configuration

The game settings can be modified in `config.py`:

- **Screen dimensions**: Adjust window size
- **Grid size**: Change block size and play area dimensions
- **Colors**: Customize tetromino piece colors
- **Shapes**: Modify tetromino piece patterns
